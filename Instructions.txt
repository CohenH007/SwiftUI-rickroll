# SwiftUI-rickroll
Swift app that uses Swift ui and subsonic ( not created by me it was created by: https://github.com/twostraws/Subsonic ) to rickroll you after you press a button
to use:
1.create a new app project in swift playgrounds and delete the text of "content view" and copy paste the code: 

import SwiftUI
import Subsonic

// this code was created by cohen if you use this code please give credit to Cohen //

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var rick = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("spawn the legend himself ?") {
            rick.toggle()
            play(sound: "Example.mp3")
        }
        if rick == true {
            Image("Rick photo")
                .imageScale(.small)
            Text("you have been rickrolled!")
        }
    }
}


2. rename rickroll photo to "Rick photo" and the mp3 to Example and add to the project

3. add the swift packge subsonic to the project by putting https://github.com/twostraws/Subsonic into the packege manager and hitting enter

4. now run the code and tap on the text and see what happens!
